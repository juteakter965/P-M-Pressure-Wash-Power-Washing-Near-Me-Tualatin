                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I find power washing services near me in Tualatin?</h3>

                    <h3>What's the benefit of using a local power washing service instead of a company from outside Tualatin?</h3>
                    <p>Local power washing services offer faster response times (often same-day), no travel fees, better knowledge of Tualatin's climate challenges, community accountability, and personalized service. Local providers understand our wet Pacific Northwest conditions and know which cleaning methods work best for properties in our area. They can also respond quickly for follow-up services or emergencies.</p>

                    <h3>Can I get same-day power washing service in Tualatin?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, many local Tualatin power washing companies, including P&M Pressure Wash, offer same-day service depending on availability and your location. Same-day service is most readily available during off-peak seasons (fall and winter) and for properties close to the provider's location. Emergency services for urgent needs (pre-event cleaning, real estate showings) can often be accommodated within hours. Call early in the day for best same-day availability.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do local power washing companies charge travel fees?</h3>
                    <p>It depends on distance. Most local Tualatin power washing providers don't charge travel fees within Tualatin city limits (0-5 miles from their location). Some may add $25-$50 for service 5-10 miles away, and $50-$100+ for distances beyond 10 miles. When choosing providers, prioritize those within 5 miles of your property to avoid travel charges. P&M Pressure Wash offers no-travel-fee service throughout Tualatin.</p>

                    <p>Local Tualatin providers typically respond to quote requests within 4-24 hours. On-site estimates are usually scheduled within 1-3 business days. Service can often be scheduled within 2-7 days from estimate approval, depending on season. During peak season (April-August), expect 1-3 week wait times. During off-season (November-February), service may be available within 2-5 days. Emergency services can sometimes be provided same-day.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What should I look for when choosing a power washing service near me?</h3>
                    <p>Verify licensing and insurance (ask for proof), check online reviews (4.5+ stars with 50+ reviews), confirm they're truly local (physical Tualatin address), evaluate experience (3+ years serving Tualatin), assess equipment quality (commercial-grade), get written estimates, ask for local references, and compare pricing from multiple providers. Avoid companies that can't provide insurance proof, only accept cash, or pressure immediate decisions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are power washing chemicals safe for my landscaping?</h3>
                    <p>Professional local power washing companies use biodegradable, plant-safe cleaning solutions. Reputable providers take precautions including pre-wetting plants, using diluted solutions, covering sensitive vegetation, directing runoff away from gardens, and thoroughly rinsing all areas. Ask your provider about their specific products and protection methods. P&M Pressure Wash uses eco-friendly solutions and has protocols to protect your landscaping throughout the service.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to be home when the power washing service arrives?</h3>
                    <p>Not necessarily. As long as the service provider has access to the areas being cleaned and a water source, you don't need to be home. Many customers leave gates unlocked, provide access codes, or arrange for key exchange. Local providers will contact you before arrival and after completion. However, being present for the initial walkthrough is recommended to discuss specific concerns and ensure all areas are addressed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the difference between power washing and pressure washing?</h3>
                    <p>Power washing uses heated water (up to 200°F) combined with high pressure, making it more effective for heavy grease, oil, and stubborn stains. Pressure washing uses cold water at high pressure. Both methods are effective when used appropriately. Most local Tualatin providers offer both services and will recommend the best method for your specific surfaces. Delicate materials like roofs typically require soft washing (low-pressure) rather than power or pressure washing.</p>
